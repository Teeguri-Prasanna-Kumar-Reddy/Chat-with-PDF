resea rch paper introduces a groundbreaking approach to automating customer service using langchain a custom llm tailored for organizations the paper explores the obsolescence of traditional customer support techniques particul arly frequently asked questions faqs and proposes a paradigm shift towards responsive context aware and personalized customer interactions the heart of this innovation lies in the fusion of open source methodologies web scraping fine tuning and th e seamless integration of langch ain into customer service platforms this open source state oftheart framework presented as sahaay demonstrates the ability to scale across industries and organizations offering real time support and query resolution key elements of this research encompass data collection via web scraping the role of embeddings the utilization of googles flan t5 xxl base and s mall language model s for knowledge retrieval and the integration of the chatbot into customer service platfor ms the results s

interaction s i introduction customer is king is the ancient mantra reflecting the significance of customers in every business in the digital age where the rhythms of mode rn life are guided by the pu

is forged this research paper brings the future of customer service where automation personalization and responsiveness converge to redefine the customer company r elationship at the heart of this transformation lies the integration of llms exemplifie d by langchain 1 in the annal s of customer service history faqs and traditional support mechanisms have long held sway these venerable tools have dutifully served as repositories of information attempting to a ddress the queries and concerns of custom ers however as we stan d at the cusp of a new era in customer service automation it becomes abundantly clear that the traditional methods once hailed as revolutionary are gradually becoming obsolete this paper i s an invitation to envision a future wher e customer service is no t a cost center but a wellspring of customer satisfaction and loyalty we propose an open source framework that can be scaled to any industry or organization to fulfill the consumer needs for support and query resolution within seco nds for demonstration p urposes we use the information presented by birla vishvakarma mahavidyalaya bvm engineering college on their website httpsbvmengineeringaci n as
